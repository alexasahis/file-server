# file-server
A simple/minimal Node.js file server with no dependencies other than Node.js itself. It started out as a means to learn a bit about Node's http module, but it turns out to be a nice quick and simple way to serve files locally. It is primarily intended for local, non-production use and hasn't been tested for robustness against any sort of attack.
